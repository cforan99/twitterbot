In this world
Of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm so glad there is you
In this world
Of all the rated pleasures
Of underrated treasures
I'm so glad there is you
I live to love
I love to live with you beside me
This world so new
I'll walk you through with you to guide me
In this world
Where many people play at love
But hardly ever stay in
I'm so glad there is you
More than ever I'm glad there is you
More than ever I'm glad there is you
I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle yes indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet you see the picture clear as day
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me, flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love
I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I need
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me, flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
Don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
Catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
You, you, you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
If I wrote a book about where we stand
Then the title of my book would be "Life with Superman"
That's how you make me feel I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same I see it everyday
In all the things you do
In all the things you say
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock

I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I
If I were to try to count the ways
You make me smile
I'd run out of fingers
Before I run out of timeless things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my lovin strong
Make me wanna try my best
To give you what you want and what you need
Give you my whole heart, not just a little piece
More than a minimum,
I'm talking everything
More than a single wish,
I'm talking every dream
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock

If there's options I don't want them
They're not worth my time
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you I like us just fine
You're a rock in the sand
You're a smile in a cry
You're my joy through the pain
You're the truth through the lies
No matter what I do I know that I can count on you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you

Ooh
Ooooooh.
Star.
Star.
I'm wishing.
I'm wishing.
On a star.
I'm wishing on a star.
To follow where you are.
I'm wishing on a dream.
To follow what it mean.
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see.
I'm wishing on the people who really dream.
And I'm wishing on tomorrow rains never comes.
And I'm wishing on the other things we never done.
I never thought I'd see the time when you would be.
So far away from home.
So far away from me.
Just think of all the moments that we spent.
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant.
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know.
In the game of love, you reap what you sow.
(So-o-o-o-w)
I feel it's time we should make up baby.
I feel it's time for us to get back together.
And make the best of things, oh baby.
When we're together.
Whether or never.
I feel it's time we should make up baby.
I feel it's time for us to get back together.
And make the best of things, oh baby.
When we're together.
Let's get together, baby.
Whether or never.
I'm wishing on a star.
To follow where you are.
I'm wishing on a dream.
To follow what it means.
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see.
I'm wishing on the people who really dream.
Hoping all the days to come and days to go.
Hoping on the days of loving, loving you so.
Baby, forgive me.
Lets make up, I'm sorry.
Lets be together, breakup?
Never.
The love we have seems special so far
Til we get back from wishing on a star.

It's 6 o'clock
And seconds feel like hours as I sit here
And watch them tick away
And just the thought
Of seeing you again I wanna sing
I've been longing for this day
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't smile untill I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I'll wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait
12 am
The crowd is getting thin but it's okay
'Cause I'm not here for them
No
I refuse
To move from the spot
Until I feel your heart
Pressed against mine again
I'm waiting!
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't smile until I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you
I don't care how long it takes
I don't mind I'm alright I'll sit and wait
'Til the sun comes down and rise
And come right back up again
You're the best thing that's happened in my life
When your aps in the bar is in my life
And it just ain't right
So take as long as you like
I'm waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting [x4]
I'm waiting
I'll be waiting
I can't smile until I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you

'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'Cause patiently I wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait right here for you
Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)
After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins
Mama, so put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Girl you so fine, put your love on top
If you're going through it, just know it's called "going THROUGH it"
You're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die
You're gonna survive
Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me
When I look in your eyes, I feel alive
Some days we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you holding me tight, I feel alive
Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
Each day I feel so blessed to be looking at you
Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name
When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive
Now let's just live it up
We gotta hold on, I gotta hold on
You've got to hold on, you've got a hold on, a hold on to me
Hold on to me, hold on
Bee-sy-ay, bee-sy-ay, bee-sy-ay
Mommy mommy mommy!
Can we see daddy?
Can we see daddy?
Miss you daddy...
I fought for you
The hardest, it made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving
But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed
So go on, go home
When the palm of my two hands, hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is, hmmm
And when my voice is screaming out, to my own ears, uh
That feels different
From when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror
After all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show ya
I guess I didn't see myself before ya
Moving forward
(Super power)
A subtle power
(Super power)
A tough love
(Super power)
Uh huh, like a shark
(Super power)
Ooh, Like a bear
A tough love
And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve, without us
Without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
They couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Hey, hey
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down
And just like you I can't be scared
And just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there
Tough love
(Super power)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls
It's a super power
(Super power)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
Cause together we got plenty super power
(Super power)
A subtle power
(Super power)
A tough love
(Super power)
Uh huh, like a shark
(Super power)
Ooh, too much to bear
And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve, without us
Without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
They couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
But together we've got plenty power
But nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down
Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down

We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls,
"You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man."
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My rock, flawless
I woke up like this
I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this
I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say I look so good tonight
God damn, God damn
Say I look so good tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine, I'm flawless!
